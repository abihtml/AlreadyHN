AlreadyHN
=========

AlreandyHN is a bookmarklet written in JavaScript that checks the current page's address against [hnsearch.com](http://www.hnsearch.com) to see if it was already posted on Hacker News.
Depending on the result it let's you view the comments or redirects you to the new submission page.


Installation
--------

Since GitHub doesn't allow to embed bookmarklets in the README file either create a new bookmark and put the content of ```src.min.js``` in it or go to my website at http://www.elias.kg and drag the bookmarklet directly to your browser's bookmark bar.


Usage
-----

1. Go to any website
2. Click on bookmarklet
